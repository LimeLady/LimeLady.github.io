                    <h3>Data Analytics & Dashboarding</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the projects I am most proud of is the Google Sheets and Looker Studio integration I did
                        for Kirkman Company.
                        By connecting the API of their CRM and ERP systems (AFAS & Hubspot) to Looker Studio using Apps
                        Scripts, I was able to create a dashboard that gives realtime insights into their project
                        planning and financials as well as employee
                        performance. Whereas I frequently work in Python and R for data manipulation, this project
                        involved complex data connections and transformation within the dashboard using SQL. It also
                        involved thorough communication with multiple stakeholders to understand their needs and KPIs.
                        <br><br>
                        Another project I am proud of is the Tableau dashboard I created during my Master's at the UvA
                        for TNO.
                        Together with a team of 4, we analyzed and modeled location data and Tweets from Black Lives
                        Matter
                        demonstrations in the US. We used NLP techniques to analyze the sentiment of the tweets and
                        created
                        a dashboard that visualizes the interaction and sentiment and location of the tweets. This
                        project
                        was complex in the large amount of data and in correctly visualizing the modeled clusters.

                    <h3>Research & Theses</h3>
                    <p>
                        I completed two Master’s theses in Data Science, focusing on distinct but innovative topics. The
                        first, at the Daan Theeuwes Center for Neurorehabilitation, involved modeling recovery
                        trajectories
                        in neurorehabilitation using Dynamic Time Warping to effectively cluster patient subgroups. This
                        research has potential implications for precision medicine, paving the way for its application
                        in
                        larger patient populations. My second thesis, completed during an internship at GroupM,
                        addressed
                        the challenge of social biases in AI-driven image generation. Through a user-centric study, I
                        evaluated the effectiveness of gender bias mitigation in these systems within an advertising
                        context, finding that the utility of these systems not only depends on the diversity and quality
                        of
                        the images produced but also on the varied backgrounds and expectations of users. This work
                        emphasizes the critical role of incorporating diverse user perceptions in the design and
                        evaluation
                        of AI systems, particularly in marketing applications.

                    <p>During my studies I have been actively engaged in the student community and extracurriculars.

                        One of the highlights of my professional portfolio is the consultancy project I undertook for
                        PwC during the Netherlands Asia Honours Summer School. Tasked with exploring how PwC Netherlands
                        could leverage technological advancements in China to enhance digital engagement with both
                        existing and potential Chinese clients, our team delved into an intensive curriculum that
                        included lectures, workshops, and virtual company visits—adapted online due to COVID-19
                        restrictions. Despite the geographical constraints, the collaboration with fellow students and
                        company representatives was highly productive and enriching. I am particularly proud of the
                        innovative strategies we developed and the tangible outcomes we achieved within the compressed
                        timeframe, which significantly enhanced our client's digital relationship strategies.

            <p>Hi! I'm Elise, a Data Science & Analytics MSc currently living in Buenos Aires,
                Argentina. Although I am originally from the Netherlands, after an intercambio
                with Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires (ITBA), I decided to live and work here the coming period in
                my life.
                I am passionate about using data to drive business decisions and solve complex problems,
                and have a strong academic background ranging from hard skills like Statistics, Data Mining, Data
                Engineering, NLP and Machine Learning,
                to soft skills like consulting, entrepreneurship and team work. I love that this background allows me to
                provide value in any sector!
                I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to explore, learn and grow. So when I am
                not working, you can find me exploring the city, sitting in the sun eating soup, learning Spanish,
                attending trivia nights, or riding horses.
